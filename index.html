            <p>I'm a software developer and designer by trade, but work across venture capital, business, marketing, software engineering, and design to help grow students into founders, and new ideas to startups.</p>

            <h2 class="underline">What I'm doing now</h2>

            <p>I'm currently studying computer science at University of California, Berkeley.</p>

            <p>This summer, I'm joining <strong><a href="https://repl.it">Repl.it</a> as a software engineering intern</strong>, working on user interfaces and JavaScript infrastructure for one of the best places online to learn and experiment with programming.</p>

            <p>I'm also ...</p>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>an Investment Partner on <a href="https://www.dormroomfund.com/">Dorm Room Fund</a>'s San Francisco team</strong>, connecting the best student startups in the Bay Area with fellow founders, investors, mentors, and seed funding.</li>

                <li><strong>a Director at <a href="https://calhacks.io">Cal Hacks</a></strong>, UC Berkeley's hackathon and the largest collegiate hackathon in the world with over 2000 students and companies in attendance every year. I also <strong>lead the Cal Hacks Fellowship program</strong>, a 12-week idea accelerator for teams and projects from Cal Hacks in partnership with VCs and entrepreneurship organizations in the city.</li>

                <li><strong>an Instructor at UC Berkeley's <a href="https://reactdecal.org">React DeCal</a> and a Teaching Assistant at <a href="http://wdd.io">Web Design DeCal</a></strong>, two student-run courses on Berkeley campus about the art and know-how of web design and development, covering the fundamentals of building engaging and maintainable interfaces on the web.</li>

                <li>Hacking on a <a href="https://linus.zone/torus">fast, tiny virtual DOM-based UI library for web applications, called <strong>Torus</strong></a>, and a code annotation tool called <strong><a href="https://linus.zone/lp">Litterate</a></strong>. I also wrote a small helper library called <strong><a href="https://github.com/thesephist/animated-value">Animated Value</a></strong>, which helps me build fluid geometry- and physics-based animations on the web.</li>

                <li>Working on <strong><a href="https://linus.zone/codeframe">Codeframe</a></strong>, an online web development environment designed to make it painless and intuitive to learn frontend web technologies. I'm planning to expand the app to come with a series of the best free courses on introductory web development on the web, being built out at <a href="https://zerotocode.org">ZeroToCode.org</a>.</li>

                <li>Tutoring for computer science courses at UC Berkeley, currently just for <i>CS 61A, Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i>. You can find more information about that at <a href="https://linus.zone/tutor">this microsite</a>.</li>

                <li>Open to speaking opportunities! If you're organizing an event about JavaScript or the web, startups, or student entrepreneurs, please get in touch.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 class="underline">Get in touch</h2>

            <p>I'm in lots of places, almost always as <strong>@thesephist</strong>, and I check most of these on at least a weekly basis.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>These days, I share most of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@thesephist">Medium @thesephist</a>.</li>
                <li>My more high-frequency thoughts are drip-fed to the rest of Internet on <a href="https://twitter.com/thesephist">Twitter @thesephist</a>.</li>
                <li>I really don't use <a href="https://instagram.com/thesephist">Instagram (@thesephist)</a> for anything important or notable, but I <em>am</em> there, if you want to connect there.</li>

            <h2 class="underline">What I've done so far</h2>
            <p>I don't really have a portfolio handy, but you can check out an informal, comprehensive list of my personal projects going back to 2013 on my <a href="https://random.thesephist.com/">archive of projects</a>, with topics ranging from theoretical physics to music and design to writing, linguistics, software, startups, poetry, and teaching.</p>

            <p>Before my time at Berkeley, I was also a member of <strong><a href="http://anvilstartups.com">The Anvil</a>'s executive team at Purdue University</strong>, helping run The Boiler startup accelerator and other events around student entrepreneurship on Purdue campus.</p>

            <p>Between high school and undergrad, I worked as a <strong>software engineer at <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spensa_Technologies">Spensa Technologies</a></strong>, an Indiana startup in precision agriculture acquired in 2018 by DTN, first as an intern then a full-time engineer. I worked on web / UI, performance, developer tools, and frontend infrastructure.</p>

            <p>When I first came to Berkeley, I spent a year as a <strong>Community Manager at <a href="https://www.catalistx.com/">CatalistX</a>, which runs <a href="https://bearx.co">BearX</a></strong>, a portal for entrepreneurs, students, and the Berkeley community around Cal's startup ecosystem.</p>

            <p>I also served as the sole <strong>developer and graphic designer for TEDxPurdueU</strong>, a small team that organizes TEDx licensed events on Purdue University campus year-round.</p>

            <h2 class="underline">What I'm doing next</h2>
            <p>Each year, I set 8-10 concrete goals to work towards. You can find my goals for 2019 <a href="https://medium.com/@thesephist/my-goals-for-2019-b1d5e93431ac">here, on my Medium</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="underline">Resume</h2>
            <p>You can download a copy of my resume <a href="linus-lee-resume.pdf">here</a>. You can also check out a <a href="https://thesephist.com/cv.md">Markdown file of past experiences and skills</a>, which contains the same information. My <a href="https://linus.zone/git">GitHub</a> and <a href="https://www.behance.net/thesephist">Behance</a> may also be useful.</p>
