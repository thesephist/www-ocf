            <h1>Linus @ Berkeley OCF</h1>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Linus. I'm a <strong>computer science student at University of California, Berkeley</strong>, and I love working on <strong>meaningful design and software projects for and in startups</strong>. You can find me over in these places online:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A good place to start would be my <a href="https://thesephist.com">website</a>.</li>
                <li>These days, I share most of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@thesephist">Medium @thesephist</a>.</li>
                <li>My more high-frequency thoughts are drip-fed to the rest of Internet on <a href="https://twitter.com/thesephist">Twitter @thesephist</a>.</li>
                <li>I really don't use <a href="https://instagram.com/thesephist">Instagram (@thesephist)</a> for anything important or notable, but I <em>am</em> there, if you want to connect there.</li>
                <li>I'm also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesephist">Facebook (thesephist)</a>, for whatever that counts.</li>
                <li>Lastly, if you're one of those people looking for my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/thesephist">LinkedIn /thesephist</a>, you can contact or follow me there, though I use it as little more than a resume.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Contact</h2>
            <p>If you'd like to reach out to me, please feel free to message or mention me on any of these platforms above. I'll try to get back to you in a reasonable timeframe. If you really must use email, it's on my website as well.</p>

            <h2>A note about resumes</h2>
            <p>If you're looking for a resume or CV, I'm afraid I don't have one handy at the moment. But you can check out a <a href="https://thesephist.com/cv.md">Markdown file of past experiences and skills</a>, which contains the same information.</p>
