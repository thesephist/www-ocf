# www-ocf

www-ocf is what I (Linus) use to version control the page that lives at [ocf.io/linuslee](ocf.io/linuslee), hosted at Berkeley's Open Computing Facility.

## Build

Right now, there are no build steps. What you have in the repo is exactly what's served.

## Deploy

Deploy is done right now with the `/deploy.sh` script, which just copies the static files from the repository to the public directory that's served by the OCF.
