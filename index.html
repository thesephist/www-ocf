            <h1>Linus</h1>
            <p>Hey there, I'm Linus. I'm a <strong>computer science student at University of California, Berkeley</strong>, and I love working on <strong>meaningful design and software projects for and in startups</strong>.</p>

            <h2>What I'm doing right now</h2>

            <p>Besides pursuing a degree in computer science at Berkeley, I'm ...</p>

            <ul>

                <li>Community Manager at <a href="https://www.catalistx.com/">CatalistX</a>, which runs <a href="https://bearfounders.com">Bear Founders</a>, a portal for entrepreneurs, students, and the Berkeley community around Cal's startup ecosystem.</li>

            </ul>

            <h2>Where I am online</h2>

            <p>I'm in lots of places, and I check most of these on at least a weekly basis.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>A good place to start would be my <a href="https://thesephist.com">website</a>.</li>
                <li>These days, I share most of my writing on <a href="https://medium.com/@thesephist">Medium @thesephist</a>.</li>
                <li>My more high-frequency thoughts are drip-fed to the rest of Internet on <a href="https://twitter.com/thesephist">Twitter @thesephist</a>.</li>
                <li>I really don't use <a href="https://instagram.com/thesephist">Instagram (@thesephist)</a> for anything important or notable, but I <em>am</em> there, if you want to connect there.</li>
                <li>I'm also on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/thesephist">Facebook (thesephist)</a>, for whatever that counts.</li>
                <li>Lastly, if you're looking for my <a href="https://linkedin.com/in/thesephist">LinkedIn /thesephist</a>, you can contact or follow me there, though I use it as little more than a resume.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>If you'd like to reach out to me, please feel free to message or mention me on any of these platforms above. I'll try to get back to you in a reasonable timeframe. If you really must use email, you can reach me at <i>l7 [at] berkeley.edu</i>.</p>

            <h2>Resume</h2>
            <p>You can download a copy of my resume <a href="linus-lee-resume.pdf" download>here</a>. You can also check out a <a href="https://thesephist.com/cv.md">Markdown file of past experiences and skills</a>, which contains the same information.</p>
